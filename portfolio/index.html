            <h2>The Web is Ephemeral</h2>
            <h1>So, here are some sites I built that may not exist anymore.</h1>
            <p>I've built a lot of 'em over the years. Many are either gone now or had a redesign
            (or three!) done after me. Not great for the resume, eh? I had to dig through some
            internet archives to find and screenshot a number of these!</p>
            <p>Note that I am not the designer of these sites; I'm just the guy who put them
            together with code stuffs. Many required custom plugins to reach their desired
            funcitonality. Also, I didn't link to them since there's no telling what's going on
            since I built them.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <h3>acluva.org</h3>
                        <p>Long before Gutenberg was a thing, I had to make these guys a new theme
                        that worked with their existing piles and piles of content.</p>

                        <p>Before they were too huge, I made their site in WordPress and their
                        custom class schedule system with CakePHP and <code>date()</code> math. It
                        even supported repeating events! It was a nice little upgrade for their
                        instructors who were previously making calendars in MS Office. Also, I don't
                        know what's up with the background; this is ancient history and it was fine
                        at the time.</p>

                        <p>The design wasn't much, but the hoops I had to push WooCommerce through
                        to make its pricing system match their internal system were kind of
                        insane. It kinda sullied my whole WooCommerce experience, but at least its
                        plentiful hooks made it possible to do what was needed.</p>

                        thing. Most everything is (heavily) restyled Gutenberg blocks.</p>

                        guys since they were on flat HTML files and moved to ExpressionEngine long,
                        long ago.</p>

                        lost something design-wise in transitioning the internet over to something
                        compatible with phones. Everything detailed and interesting was replaced
                        with simplicity and flatness for maximum compatibility and efficiency.</p>
