        <p>Dunno what to play in the upcoming Legacy of Phrecia event? Me either. I kept referencing <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3718913">the post about the new Ascendancy classes</a> but figured there might be a better way. This is perhaps it: the text for each image has been added to the document but hidden, and that allows this little form input to search it. Vague ideas about, say, "blind" or "chaos" can be searched to find relevant classes or you can search for the class name itself to quickly pare the list down. Reminder: GGG spells things Britishly, so it's not "defense" but "defence" and so on.</p>
